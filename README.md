What is PostgreSQL?

PostgreSQL is one of the most advanced general-purpose object-relational database management system and is open-source. Being an open-source software, its source code is available under PostgreSQL license, a liberal open source license. Anyone with the right skills is free to use, modify, and distribute PostgreSQL in any form. As it is highly stable, very low effort is required to maintain this DBMS.

Why PostgreSQL is best for you?
The key features that make PostgreSQL a reliable and user-friendly are listed below:

User-defined types
Table inheritance
Sophisticated locking mechanism
Foreign key referential integrity
Views, rules, subquery
Nested transactions (savepoints)
Multi-version concurrency control (MVCC)
Asynchronous replication
Native Microsoft Windows Server version
Tablespaces
Point-in-time recovery
Why PostgreSQL is unique in itself?
Below is the list of features that makes PostgreSQL stand-out among other DBMS:

The multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) feature was first implemented by PostgreSQL.
Custom functions developed in languages like C/C++, Python, Java, etc can be added to PostgreSQL.
As PostgreSQL is designed to be extensible, one can define their own data types, index types, functional languages, etc.
If one intends to remove any part of the system, one can always develop a custom plugin to enhance it to meet their specific requirements.
Large Scale users of PostgreSQL
A number of companies have built products and solutions using PostgreSQL. Few of those companies are Apple, Fujitsu, Red Hat, Cisco, Juniper Network, etc




How can you calculate aggregate functions like COUNT(), SUM(), and AVG() in PostgreSQL?

Aggregate functions perform a calculation on a set of rows and return a single row .

COUNT -> is used to find how many rows are in a table
 Exmp : Select * from table_name 


 SUM -> s used to calculate the total (sum) of a numeric column in a table.
  Exmp :  select sum(salary) as coloum_salary_sum from table_naem 

  AVG -> use to calculate the total (Avg) of numeric coloumn in a table ;
   exmp: select avg(salary) from table_name
